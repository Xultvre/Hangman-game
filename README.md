# Hangman-game
This is a Python-based Hangman game where players guess the name of a language from a curated list of globally spoken languages. The goal is to uncover the word letter by letter within six attempts, while incorrect guesses gradually reveal the iconic hangman illustration.

Features:
Random Word Selection: A language is chosen at random for each game to keep it fresh and challenging.
User Interaction: Players enter their names (validated for alphabets) and receive personalized prompts.
Dynamic Feedback: Correct guesses reveal the word's letters, while incorrect ones reduce the number of attempts and update the hangman visualization.
Win/Lose Outcome: Players win by guessing the word before their attempts run out or lose with the word revealed.
